A VERY simple two button dot/dash app for SEN students

I created this for a teaching colleague who wanted a very simple app that students with a wide range of SEN challenges could engage with. It uses a 'Morse' type effect, though the buttons are marked 'Short' & 'Long' so that the word ties in with the sound length.
